# Python Quizzler App
The Python Quizzler App is a simple quiz application built using Python and the tkinter library.

The purpose of building this app is to review what we learned about using API
endpoints and sending requests to a particular end point to ask for some piece
of data. - [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

We're going to be working with a trivia API to create a quiz app called
Quizzler. We're going to be using an API that we've seen before a long time ago called
the open trivia database - which contains over 3000 verified questions
which we can pick from randomly to fill into our quiz application.


## Features
- Interactive quiz interface.
- Score tracking and display.
- Data fetch fron API 
- tkinter for building UI

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
